inappropriagallery

This is a local server hosting your own personal picture gallery, with the option to post those images directly to Tumblr.  This is good skimming those large collections you have sitting around.

Start it running and point your browser to localhost:8014 to see your gallery.  Click the right "Reload" button to load different images.  If you find one you like, click on it to get a caption box and the option to submit it to your tumblr.

gallery.py -- The command line version.  Run it as

    python gallery.py /path/to/your/pictures 10 inappropriamatic@gmail.com hunter2
    
Where /path/to/your/pictures is a directory, and 10 is the number of images you want on the page at a time.  I didn't bother to bounds check that (lazy, I know), so make sure that number is less than the number of pictures you have.  The email address and password are optional, but you can't submit to tumblr without them.

If that sounds like too much work, you always have

gallerygui.py -- The graphical version.

This version will prompt you with dialog boxes for each of those parameters, and then launch your browser for you.
